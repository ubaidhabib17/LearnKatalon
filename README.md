# Learn Katalon Studio

I went through an exciting learning journey to become skilled in web testing using Katalon Studio. This project provided a step-by-step guide that helped me learn the basics and advanced techniques of automated testing on websites.

Starting out, I learned how to set up Katalon Studio and create my first web testing project. I then learned how to interact with different parts of websites like buttons, forms, and dropdown menus. As I progressed, I explored moving between web pages, checking elements, and handling things that change on the page.

I also discovered data-driven testing, which involves testing different scenarios using data. Plus, I learned about keyword-driven testing, a way to make testing scripts more organized and easy to change.

As I got more advanced, I tackled more complex tasks like moving the mouse around, dragging and dropping elements, and working with embedded website parts. I also became good at testing forms on websites and dealing with popups and alerts.

Throughout the learning process, I got tips on what works best and had chances to practice on real projects that were like real-world tests.

Now, I feel confident and ready to handle web testing challenges. This GitHub project guided me from being a beginner to someone who really understands web testing with Katalon Studio. I'm excited to use these new skills at work and keep getting better at web testing
